## Hello dear contributor üëã We are happy to have you on board!

Let's have a quick overview about how you can help to make this project better for all. We are just starting with this and we like to keep things as simple as possible. On the other side, we also need to make sure, that we can handle the maintainer job without too much time investment because most of us doing this as a side gig and not for a living. 

### At this point, we have set up three simple rules that we ask you to follow. üëá

### Please fork this repo and do not simply clone it

The reason for this is, that with a fork you get full control over your copy of the original repository under your own account on GitHub. This means that you can simply push any changes you made on your code up to your remote repo. If you use a clone of the original repository, this would only be possible, if you were a registered contributor with write access to the original repo. This does not affect your option to submit a pull request (PR) to have your changes merged into the main branch (our production branch) of the original repo. In this YT Video, you can have a good introduction to the difference between a fork and a clone.

### Please open an issue before creating a pull request

We like to have a clean process for pull requests and therefore we ask you to always open an issue before submitting your PR. We know that many people might disagree with this practice and find it cumbersome or disruptive. Asking you to do this will prevent duplicate work from our valued contributors. If you always check the issues first, before even starting to work on a contribution, this makes sure, that you don't waste your precious time. This is a mandatory prerequisite to get your PR approved. Please notice, that we will assign every issue to a contributor who then owns the right to submit a corresponding pull request. PR's submitted from contributors that are not the assignee of a corresponding issue will not get approved, other than the assignee lacks of doing the work in a reasonable time. We hope you can live with this and we thank you for your understanding. 

### Please use the appropriate markdown documents for discussions

Our goal is to preserve the discussions of our community inside the git controlled repository. What does that even mean? Well, the issues and discussion features of GitHub are a good thing. There is nothing wrong in using them. It is our goal and philosophy to not being locked in to any particular vendor or platform. We love GitHub and have no plans to leave it with this project. As recent events around different company owned services have brought to our all awareness, it could be possible to have to move to another solution with a project. In that case, we don't want to lose the discussions and questions and answers that make an essential part of this shared knowledge repository. That is why we do not enable the discussion and wiki options of GitHub, but having an equivalent option that is under source control. 

### This feature is not ready at this moment. We are working on it. Please open an issue if you have questions or suggestions what we can do better. Thank you! ü§ù
