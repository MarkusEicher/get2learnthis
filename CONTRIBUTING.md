## Hello dear contributor ðŸ‘‹ We are happy to have you on board!

Let's have a quick overview about how you can help to make this project better for all.
We are just starting with this and we like to keep things as simple as possible. On the 
other side, we also need to make sure, that we can handle the maintainer job without too
much time investment because most of us doing this as a side gig and not for a living. 

At this point, we have set up three simple rules that we ask you to follow.

### Please fork this repo and do not simply clone it

The reason for this is, that with a fork you get full control over your copy of the original
repository under your own account on GitHub. This means that you can simply push any changes
you made on your code up to your remote repo. If you use a clone of the original repository, 
this would only be possible, if you were a registered contributor with write access to the
original repo. This does not affect your option to submit a pull request (PR) to have your 
changes merged into the main branch (our production branch) of the original repo. In this YT
Video, you can have a good introduction to the difference between a fork and a clone.
